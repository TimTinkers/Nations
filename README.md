# Nations
An eventual nation-building game.

A work-in-progress being built using the LibGDX OpenGL framework. Currently functional is support for rendering various "planets"--currently just hexagon-tiled spheres. The first milestone of abstracting away rendering simple triangles into a more robust tile/border color control scheme is complete, and currently the goal is to implement logic for generating realistic-looking landmasses and planetscapes.

Here are some images of the project's results:
